Share my project from Hyperskill

- Introduction to Python: Loan Calculator
- Introduction to Data Science: HR Data Analysis
  > This project guides you through advanced data handling and analysis using Python and pandas—from reindexing XML datasets to merging and pivoting data.
- Introduction to Data Science: House Classification
  > This project aims to show you the basic workflow of training a machine learning algorithm, from importing the data to evaluating the model’s performance. Moreover, you will learn how to use different data encoders.
- Introduction to Data Science: Data Analysis for Hospitals
  > Conduct a comprehensive data study using the pandas library: from uploading data and correcting errors in the CSV files to simple data visualization.
- Introduction to Data Science: Salary Prediction
  > Practice fitting linear models with scikit-learn to predict values on the unknown data. Apply polynomial feature engineering, test your data for multicollinearity, and evaluate models with the MAPE score.
- Introduction to Data Science: Classification of Handwritten Digits
  > Get hands-on experience with the Keras dataset, train a variety of classification algorithms, and find the best one using scikit-learn tools.
- Introduction to Data Science: NBA Data Preprocessing
  > Learn how to handle missing values in numerical and categorical variables, clean a DataFrame using element-wise operations, handle high-cardinality features, and engineer new features from the existing ones. Determine which features to keep and which ones to drop in the case of multicollinearity and get to know data transformation techniques.
